# T-Pot Honeypot Lab: Capturing and Analyzing Attacks Using ELK Stack

This project sets up a **T-Pot Honeypot** in a virtualized environment. **T-Pot** is an all-in-one honeypot platform developed by *Deutsche Telekom Security*. It integrates multiple honeypot services (SSH, HTTP, malware traps) with an **ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) stack** for centralized logging and visualization. T-Pot bundles multiple honeypots (e.g., Cowrie, Dionaea, Conpot) and it can be used to simulate a target environment and allows us to analyze attacker behavior in a controlled setting.

## What is a Honeypot? 🍯

A **honeypot** is a decoy system or service designed to attract cyber attackers. It pretends to be a real target (like a web server, database, or SSH login) but is actually set up to trick attackers into interacting with it. A honeypot records everything the attacker does like commands, IPs, and tools used. This can help defenders study the bad actor's hacking behavior and improve security.

> [!NOTE]
> **EXAMPLE**: You set up a fake SSH server on your network. An attacker tries to log in with root and guess passwords. The honeypot lets them think they’re succeeding, while secretly recording every move they make.

## What is an ELK Stack?

**ELK** is a group of tools used together for collecting, searching, and visualizing data and logs. It stands for:

1. **Elasticsearch**:	Stores and searches through logs and data.
2. **Logstash**:	Collects, processes, and sends logs.
3. **Kibana**:	Creates dashboards to view the data.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> **HOW IT WORKS**: Your honeypot creates logs, like failed logins or scanned ports. **Logstash** collects and organizes those logs. **Elasticsearch** stores them so you can search and filter through them quickly. **Kibana** shows it all in graphs, charts, and dashboards.

## 📌 Project Goals

### 1. Deploy a realistic honeypot using T-Pot:

  - The multi-service honeypot environment will mimic a live environment to detect and log unauthorized access attempts.
   
### 2. Attract and log simulated attack traffic:

  - We will be using tools such as `nmap`, `hydra`, `nikto`, and `gobuster` on a separate attacker VM to simulate scanning, brute-force, and exploit attempts. All interaction attempts are logged and stored for analysis on the **Kibana dashboard**.

### 3. Explore and analyze logs in Kibana dashboards:

  - Events will be sorted by IP address, timestamps, targeted services, and attack patterns using Kibana dashboards. This offers hands-on experience with SIEM log management and visibility into attacker behavior.

### 4. Demonstrate Blue Team monitoring and threat analysis:

  - We will be investigating logs and identifying attack patterns. There will also be documentation of attacker behaviors, timeline of events, and a basic threat analysis. This process simulates SOC Analyst (Blue Team) responsibilities and demonstrates cybersecurity investigation skills.
