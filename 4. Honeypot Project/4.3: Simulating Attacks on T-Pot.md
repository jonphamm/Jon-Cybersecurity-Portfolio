# ⚔️ Simulating Attacks on T-Pot Server

Now, we will be simulating a couple **attacks** against our T-Pot server. This will generate information on our **Kibana dashboard** and allow us to see information regarding honeypot data, system logs, timestamp of events, and network activity captured by the sensors.

## A) Network Scan: `nmap`

1. On a separate VM machine (e.g., Ubuntu, Kali Linux), we will run the `nmap` command to scan the T-Pot server for open ports and services.

````
sudo nmap -sT -A -T4 <T-Pot-IP>
````

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you adjust the T-Pot IP accordingly.

</br>

2. After the `nmap` scan, go back to the **T-Pot web UI** and you should see attacks generate on the **Kibana dashboard**.

</br>

To dive deeper, we'll take look at the event logs of the `nmap` scan.

3. On the **Kibana dashboard**, go to the "**Discover**" tab.

4. Next, enter the following into the search bar to filter for any **scan** events:

````
event_type: "scan" OR dst_port: * OR protocol: * 
````

> [!NOTE]
> Here you can get detailed insight into all the **scan** event logs and even see the **destination IP** of the `nmap` scan. 

</br>

## B) Brute-Force Attack: `hydra`

1. On the same VM from **Part A**, we will run the `hydra` command to perform a **brute-force attack** against the T-Pot server.
