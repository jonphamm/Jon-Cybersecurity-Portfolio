# ⚔️ Simulating Attacks on T-Pot Server

Now, we will be simulating a couple **attacks** against our T-Pot server. This will generate information on our **Kibana dashboard** and allow us to see information regarding honeypot data, system logs, timestamp of events, and network activity captured by the sensors.

## A) Network Scan: `nmap`

On a separate VM machine (e.g., Ubuntu, Kali Linux), we will run the `nmap` command to scan the T-Pot server for open ports and services.

1. Run the following `nmap` command:
   
````
sudo nmap -sT -A -T4 <T-Pot-IP>
````

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you adjust the T-Pot IP accordingly.

</br>

2. After the `nmap` scan, go back to the **T-Pot web UI** and you should see attacks generate on the **Kibana dashboard**.

</br>

To dive deeper, we'll take look at the event logs of the `nmap` scan.

3. On the **Kibana dashboard**, go to the "**Discover**" tab.

4. Next, enter the following into the search bar to filter for any **scan** events:

````
event_type: "scan" OR dst_port: * OR protocol: * 
````

> [!NOTE]
> Here you can get detailed insight into all the **scan** event logs and even see the **destination IP** of the `nmap` scan. 

</br>

## B) Brute-Force Attack: `hydra`

On the same VM from **Part A**, we will run the `hydra` command to perform a **brute-force attack** against the T-Pot server.

However, we will first create some text files with random text to use for our attack:  `userlist.txt` and `passlist.txt`

1. Run the following commmands:

````
echo "admin" > userlist.txt
````
````
echo "123456" > passlist.txt
````

</br>

2. Next, we'll do a basic **SSH brute-force attack** by running the `hyda` command to test the text files we created:

````
hydra -L userlist.txt -P passlist.txt ssh://<TPOT-IP> -t 4 -V
````

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure to adjust the "**T-POT-IP**" accordingly.


3. On the **Kibana dashboard**, we'll go to the "**Discover**" tab and search for the brute-force attack logs.

4. In the search bar, enter the following and be sure to adjust the **attacker_IP** accordingly:

````
eventid: "cowrie.login.failed" AND src_ip: "<attacker_IP>"
````

> [!NOTE]
> **Cowrie** is the main honeypot used to detect and simulate SSH attacks, especially `hydra` brute-force attacks, which is why we include it in the search criteria.

## C) Vulnerability Scan: `nikto`

**Nikto** is a **web server vulnerability scanner** that helps identify potential security issues on websites and web servers by scanning them for known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and outdated software.

1. Now, we will use `nikto` to run a basic vulnerability web server scan against our T-Pot server:

````
nikto -h http://<T-POT-IP>
````

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to adjust the **T-POT-IP** accordingly.
