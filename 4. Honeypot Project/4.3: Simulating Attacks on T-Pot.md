# ⚔️ Simulating Attacks on T-Pot Server

Now, we will be simulating a couple **attacks** against our T-Pot server. This will generate information on our **Kibana dashboard** and allow us to see information regarding honeypot data, system logs, timestamp of events, and network activity captured by the sensors.

## A) Network Scan: `nmap`

On a separate VM machine (e.g., Ubuntu, Kali Linux), we will run the `nmap` command to scan the T-Pot server for open ports and services.

1. Run the following `nmap` command:
   
````
sudo nmap -sT -A -T4 <T-Pot-IP>
````

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you adjust the T-Pot IP accordingly.

</br>

2. After the `nmap` scan, go back to the **T-Pot web UI** and you should see attacks generate on the **Kibana dashboard**.

</br>

To dive deeper, we'll take look at the event logs of the `nmap` scan.

3. On the **Kibana dashboard**, go to the "**Discover**" tab.

4. Next, enter the following into the search bar to filter for any **scan** events:

````
event_type: "scan" OR dst_port: * OR protocol: * 
````

> [!NOTE]
> Here you can get detailed insight into all the **scan** event logs and even see the **destination IP** of the `nmap` scan. 

</br>

## B) SSH Brute-Force Attack: `hydra`

**Hydra** is a brute-forcing tool used to guess login credentials through common protocols like SSH, RDP, and FTP. It uses username and password lists usually targeting login forms and remote services.

On the same VM from **Part A**, we will run the `hydra` command to perform a **SSH brute-force attack** against the T-Pot server. However, we will first create some text files with random text to use for our attack:  `userlist.txt` and `passlist.txt`

1. Run the following commmands:

````
echo "admin" > userlist.txt
````
````
echo "123456" > passlist.txt
````

</br>

2. Next, we'll do a basic **SSH brute-force attack** by running the `hyda` command to test the text files we created:

````
hydra -L userlist.txt -P passlist.txt ssh://<TPOT-IP> -t 4 -V
````

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure to adjust the "**T-POT-IP**" accordingly.

</br>

3. On the **Kibana dashboard**, we'll go to the "**Discover**" tab and search for the brute-force attack logs.

4. In the search bar, enter the following and be sure to adjust the **attacker_IP** accordingly:

````
eventid: "cowrie.login.failed" AND src_ip: "<attacker_IP>"
````

> [!NOTE]
> **Cowrie** is the main honeypot used to detect and simulate SSH attacks, especially `hydra` brute-force attacks, which is why we include it in the search criteria.

## C) Directory Brute-Force Attack: `gobuster`

**Gobuster** is a fast and powerful brute-forcing tool used to discover hidden directories and files on a web server. It utilizes HTTP and HTTPS as well as wordlists of paths or files as input.

To begin our attack, we'll need to have a wordlist for our input. 

1. Install a sample wordlist on your attacker VM with the following command:

````
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/master/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -O common.txt
````

2. Next, run the `gobuster` command against the T-Pot server:

````
gobuster dir -u http://<T-POT-IP>:8080 -w ./common.txt -t 50
````

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure to adjust the "**T-POT-IP**" accordingly.

</br>

3. On the **Kibana dashboard**, we'll go to the "**Discover**" tab and search for the brute-force attack logs.

4. In the search bar, enter the following:

````
user_agent: "*gobuster*"
````

</br>

## D) Vulnerability Scan: `nikto`

**Nikto** is a **web server vulnerability scanner** that helps identify potential security issues on websites and web servers by scanning them for known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and outdated software.

1. Now, we will use the `nikto` command to run a basic **vulnerability web server scan** against our T-Pot server:

````
nikto -h http://<T-POT-IP>
````

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to adjust the **T-POT-IP** accordingly.

2. If you'd like to save the results of the `nikto` scan, you can do so with the following command:

````
nikto -h http://<T-POT-IP> -o result.txt
````

> [!NOTE]
> This command saves the scan results into a text file named "**result.txt**", but you can name it whatever you'd like.

</br>

### This concludes the project, where we successfully performed simulated attacks against the T-Pot server. Below, you can see the updated attack count recorded by our T-Pot honeypot.
