# ⚔️ Simulating An Attack on T-Pot Server

Now, we will be simulating a couple **attacks** against our T-Pot server. This will generate information on our **Kibana dashboard** and allow us to see information regarding honeypot data, system logs, timestamp of events, and network activity captured by the sensors.

## A) Network Scan: `nmap`

1. On a separate VM machine (e.g., Ubuntu, Kali Linux), we will run the `nmap` command to scan the T-Pot server for open ports and services.

````
sudo nmap -sT -A -T4 <T-Pot-IP>
````

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you adjust the T-Pot IP accordingly.
