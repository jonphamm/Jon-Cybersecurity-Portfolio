# T-Pot Honeypot Project

This project sets up a **T-Pot Honeypot Lab** in a virtualized environment. T-Pot integrates multiple honeypot services (SSH, HTTP, malware traps) with an **ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) stack** for centralized logging and visualization. T-Pot bundles multiple honeypots (e.g., Cowrie, Dionaea, Conpot) and it is used to simulate a high-interaction target environment and analyze attacker behavior in a controlled setting.

## üìå Project Goals

- Deploy a realistic honeypot using T-Pot
- Attract and log simulated attack traffic
- Explore and analyze logs in Kibana dashboards
- Demonstrate blue team monitoring and threat analysis
