## ✅ Installation Steps:

## A) Ubuntu Virtual Machine

1. Navigate to the [official T-Pot GitHub repo](https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce) to install the Ubuntu server ISO.
2. Create a new Ubuntu VM in VMware.
3. Boot up the Ubuntu VM and follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.
4. Run these commands to ensure your Ubuntu's software list is up-to-date:
````
sudo apt update
````
````
sudo apt upgrade
````

</br>

## B) Docker Installation

**T-Pot** runs almost entirely on **Docker containers**. That means each **honeypot** (like Cowrie and Dionaea), the **ELK stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), and **support tools** are isolated inside individual Docker containers. Docker containers are mini-environments that make it super easy to run apps like honeypots, dashboards, and security tools without breaking your system.

Since we are installing T-Pot *manually* (e.g., on a base Ubuntu system), we'll need a **Docker installation script** to:

1. Install **Docker Engine** required to run all the honeypots and services.
2. Pull all T-Pot container images. 
3. Set up **Docker Compose** & networking to manage how containers talk to each other.
4. Keeps logs, configurations, and captured data orgainzed in the right folders.
5. Auto-start containers at boot. Keeps honeypots running even after a reboot.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you try to install T-Pot manually, but *skip* the **Docker setup script**:
> Honeypots won’t launch, logs won’t be collected, Kibana dashboards won’t show anything, and you’ll get errors like:
> ````
> docker: command not found
> ````

To install the **Docker script** that includes Docker Engine and Docker Compose, you'll need to navigate to this [link](https://wiki.kitpro.us/en/articles/docker-script) and follow the instructions.
