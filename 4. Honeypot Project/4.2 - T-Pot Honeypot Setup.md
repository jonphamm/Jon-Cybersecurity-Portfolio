## Installation Steps:

### A) Ubuntu Virtual Machine

1. Navigate to the [official T-Pot GitHub repo](https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce/releases) to install the Ubuntu server ISO.
2. Create a new Ubuntu VM in VMware.
3. Boot up the Ubuntu VM and follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.
4. Run these commands to ensure your Ubuntu's software list is up-to-date:
````
sudo apt update
````
````
sudo apt upgrade
````

### B) Docker Installation

**T-Pot** runs almost entirely on **Docker containers**. That means each **honeypot** (like Cowrie and Dionaea), the **ELK stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), and **support tools** are isolated inside individual Docker containers. Docker containers are mini-environments that make it super easy to run apps like honeypots, dashboards, and security tools without breaking your system.

Since we are installing T-Pot manually (e.g., on a base Ubuntu system), we'll need a **Docker installation script** to:

1. Install Docker Engine required to run all the honeypots and services.
2. Pull all T-Pot container images. Each honeypot runs in its own Docker container.
3. Set up Docker Compose & networking. Manages how containers talk to each other.
4. Keeps logs, configurations, and captured data orgainzed in the right folders.
5. Auto-start containers at boot. Keeps honeypots running even after a reboot.
