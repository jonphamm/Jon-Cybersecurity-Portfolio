# Phase 1: Reconnaissance ðŸ”Ž

The goal of this phase is to gather intelligence about the target (Metasploitable VM) before launching an attack using both **passive** and **active** reconnaissance. 

To start, let's first find the IP address of both the **Metasploitable2** and **Kali Linux** VM to ensure you have the correct network adapter configurations and that they are on the same subnet.

On the **Metasploitable2 VM**:
```
ifconfig
```
On the **Kali Linux VM**:

```
ip a
```

> [!NOTE]
> Look for the '**eth0 inet addr**' IP. You should see something along the lines of: `192.168.xxx.xxx/24`
>
> Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0` (aka `/24`)


## Passive Reconnaissance:

Since it is confirmed that the attacker and target VMs are on the same network, We will be using **Wireshark** to sniff traffic on the network to look for IP addresses, credentials, and exposed services without interacting with the target directly. 

## Active Reconnaissance: 

We will use `nmap` to scan the target VM by sending probe packets to identify open ports and running services.

On the Kali Linux attacker VM, run the following command and be sure to adjust the '**METASPLOITABLE-IP**' accordingly:

```
nmap -sS -sV <METASPLOITABLE-IP>
```
