# Phase 1: Reconnaissance ðŸ”Ž

The goal of this phase is to gather intelligence about the target (Metasploitable VM) before launching an attack using both **passive** and **active** reconnaissance. 

## Passive Reconnaissance:

we will be using **Wireshark** to sniff traffic on the network to look for IP addresses, credentials, or exposed services without interacting with the target directly. 

## For **active** reconnaissance, we will use `nmap` to scan the target VM by sending probe packets to identify open ports and running services.
