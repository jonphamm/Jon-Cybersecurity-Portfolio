# Phase 1: Reconnaissance ðŸ”Ž

The goal of this phase is to gather intelligence about the target (Metasploitable VM) before launching an attack using both **passive** and **active** reconnaissance. 

To start, let's first find the IP address of the **Metasploitable2** VM. Run the following command in the **Metasploitable2** VM:

```
ifconfig
```
> [!NOTE]
> Look for the '**inet addr**' IP: 192.168.xxx.xxx


## Passive Reconnaissance:

We will be using **Wireshark** to sniff traffic on the network to look for IP addresses, credentials, or exposed services without interacting with the target directly. 

## Active Reconnaissance: 

We will use `nmap` to scan the target VM by sending probe packets to identify open ports and running services.
