# Phase 1: Reconnaissance ðŸ”Ž

The goal of this phase is to gather intelligence about the target (Metasploitable VM) before launching an attack using both **passive** and **active** reconnaissance. 

To start, let's first find the IP address of both the **Metasploitable2** and **Kali Linux** VM to ensure they are on the same subnet:

On the Metasploitable2 VM:
```
ifconfig
```
On the Kali Linux VM:

```
ip a
```

> [!NOTE]
> Look for the '**eth0 inet addr**' IP: 192.168.xxx.xxx


## Passive Reconnaissance:

We will be using **Wireshark** to sniff traffic on the network to look for IP addresses, credentials, or exposed services without interacting with the target directly. 

## Active Reconnaissance: 

We will use `nmap` to scan the target VM by sending probe packets to identify open ports and running services.

On the Kali Linux attacker VM, run the following command and be sure to adjust the '**METASPLOITABLE-IP**' accordingly:

```
nmap -sS -sV <METASPLOITABLE-IP>
```
