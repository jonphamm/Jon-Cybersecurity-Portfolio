# Phase 1: Reconnaissance ðŸ”Ž

The goal of this phase is to gather intelligence about the target (Metasploitable VM) before launching an attack using both **passive** and **active** reconnaissance. 

To start, let's first find the IP address of both the **Metasploitable2** and **Kali Linux** VM to ensure you have the correct network adapter configurations and that they are on the same subnet.

On the **Metasploitable2 VM**:
```
ifconfig
```
On the **Kali Linux VM**:

```
ip a
```

> [!NOTE]
> Look for the '**eth0 inet addr**' IP. You should see something along the lines of: `192.168.xxx.xxx/24`
>
> Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0` (aka `/24`)
>
> Both VMs should be have a subnet mask of `/24`.


## Passive Reconnaissance:

Since it is confirmed that the attacker and target VMs are on the same network, we will be using **Wireshark** to sniff traffic on the network to look for IP addresses and exposed services without interacting with the target directly. 

## Active Reconnaissance: 

To begin, we can use `arp-scan` on the attacker machine (Kali Linux) to locate the target machine's (Metasploitable2) IP address:

```
arp-scan --localnet
```

> [!NOTE]
> `arp-scan` actively sends **ARP requests** to every IP address in the local subnet.

Next, we will use `nmap` to scan the target VM by sending probe packets to identify open ports and running services. Run the following command and be sure to adjust the '**METASPLOITABLE-IP**' accordingly:

```
nmap -sS -sV <METASPLOITABLE-IP>
```

> [!NOTE]
> **-sS**: Stealth SYN Scan (performs a half-open TCP scan, sending only the initial SYN packet, and not completing the full handshake to remain stealthy)
> 
> **-sV**: Probes for open ports and detects running services and their current versions.
