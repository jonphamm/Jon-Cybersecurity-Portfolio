# Kali Linux & Metasploitable Virtual Machine Setup üõ†Ô∏è

## A) Kali Linux VM Setup

**Kali Linux** is a Linux distribution designed primarily for cybersecurity professionals and ethical hackers. It is the go-to operating system for those who need a powerful suite of security tools in one package and comes preloaded with hundreds of built-in tools for tasks like penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, digital forensics, and security research. It includes popular tools like **Nmap**, **Metasploit**, **Aircrack-ng**, and many more.

Navigate to this [link](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines) and download the appropriate **.vmx file** for the VM software you are using (in our case, we'll be using Vmware).

## B) Metasploitable VM Setup

**Metasploitable** is an intentionally vulnerable Linux VM. It can be used to conduct security training, test security tools, and practice common penetration testing techniques without risking real systems.

Navigate to this [link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/) to download the Metasploitable zip file.

> [!NOTE]
> The default Metasploitable VM login and password is: **msfadmin**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Never expose this VM to an untrusted network (**use NAT or Host-only adapter**). This allows Kali Linux (attacker VM) to connect and test vulnerabilities on Metasploitable without risk.
