# Penetration Testing Using the Cyber Kill Chain Framework 🔗

In this project, I will utilize **Kali Linux** to conduct a penetration testing simulation targeting the vulnerable **Metasploitable2** virtual machine. The attack process will follow the **Cyber Kill Chain** framework developed by Lockheed Martin. Each of the seven stages will be examined in detail while showcasing the attack from the perspective of the attacker.

## What is the Cyber Kill Chain framework? 『』

The **Cyber Kill Chain** framework describes the stages of a cyberattack from the attacker’s perspective. It is often used to help cybersecurity professionals understand how attacks occur, so they can detect, prevent, and respond to threats more effectively.

The framework breaks down a cyberattack into **7 distinct stages**:

### 1. Reconnaissance 🔎

This is the initial phase in a cyberattack where an attacker gathers information about a target to find weaknesses or vulnerabilities to exploit later. The attacker is doing research before launching an attack. Note that there are 2 types of reconnaissance:
    
- **Passive Reconnaissance**: Involves obtaining information about the target without directly interacting with their systems. Attackers use public sources like websites, social media, or company reports. Since there is no direct contact, it is less likely to be detected.
       
- **Active Reconnaissance**: Involves directly probing or scanning the target’s systems or network to gather information, such as open ports, services, or vulnerabilities. This involves interaction, which has a higher risk of detection by the target’s security systems.

### 2. Weaponization ⚔

This is the second phase where the attacker creates a malicious payload to exploit vulnerabilities discovered in the Reconnaissance phase. Types of weaponization payloads can include:

- **Malware**: Viruses, worms, Trojans, and ransomeware.
  
- **Exploit Kits**: Software tools that automate exploiting vulnerabilities.

- **Backdoors**: Tools that allow attackers to maintain access.

- **Remote Access Trojans (RATs)**: Malware that give remote control of a system.
