# Penetration Testing Using the Cyber Kill Chain Framework ðŸ”—

In this project, I will utilize **Kali Linux** to conduct a penetration testing simulation targeting the vulnerable **Metasploitable2** virtual machine. The attack process will follow the **Cyber Kill Chain** framework developed by Lockheed Martin. Each of the seven stages will be examined in detail, showcasing the attack from the perspective of the attacker.
