# Penetration Testing Using the Cyber Kill Chain Framework üîó

In this project, I will utilize **Kali Linux** to conduct a penetration testing simulation targeting the vulnerable **Metasploitable2** virtual machine. The attack process will follow the **Cyber Kill Chain** framework developed by Lockheed Martin. Each of the seven stages will be examined in detail while showcasing the attack from the perspective of the attacker.

## What is the Cyber Kill Chain framework? „Äé„Äè

The **Cyber Kill Chain** framework describes the stages of a cyberattack from the attacker‚Äôs perspective. It is often used to help cybersecurity professionals understand how attacks occur, so they can detect, prevent, and respond to threats more effectively.

The framework breaks down a cyberattack into **7 distinct stages**:

### 1. Reconnaissance

  - This is the initial phase in a cyberattack where an attacker gathers information about a target to find weaknesses or vulnerabilities to exploit later. The attacker is doing research before launching an attack. Note that there are 2 types of reconnaissance:
    
     - Active Reconnaissance: 
     - Passive Reconnaissance:

### 2. Weaponization

### 3. Delivery

### 4. Exploitation

### 5. Installation

### 6. Command and Control (C2)

### 7. Actions on Objectives
