# Penetration Testing Using the Cyber Kill Chain Framework 🔗

In this project, I will utilize **Kali Linux** to conduct a penetration testing simulation targeting the vulnerable **Metasploitable2** virtual machine. The attack process will follow the **Cyber Kill Chain** framework developed by Lockheed Martin. Each of the seven stages will be examined in detail while showcasing the attack from the perspective of the attacker.

## What is the Cyber Kill Chain framework? 『』

The **Cyber Kill Chain** framework describes the stages of a cyberattack from the attacker’s perspective. It is often used to help cybersecurity professionals understand how attacks occur, so they can detect, prevent, and respond to threats more effectively.

The framework breaks down a cyberattack into **7 distinct stages**:

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance 🔎

This is the initial phase in a cyberattack where an attacker gathers information about a target to find weaknesses or vulnerabilities to exploit. The attacker is doing research before launching an attack. Note that there are 2 types of reconnaissance:
    
- **Passive Reconnaissance**: Involves obtaining information about the target without directly interacting with their systems. Attackers use public sources like websites, social media, or company reports. Since there is no direct contact, it is less likely to be detected.
       
- **Active Reconnaissance**: Involves directly probing or scanning the target’s systems or network to gather information, such as open ports, services, or vulnerabilities. This involves interaction, which has a higher risk of detection by the target’s security systems.

### Phase 2: Weaponization ⚔

This is the second phase where the attacker creates a malicious payload to exploit vulnerabilities discovered in the Reconnaissance phase. Types of weaponization payloads can include:

- **Malware**: Viruses, worms, Trojans, and ransomeware.

- **Backdoors**: Tools that allow attackers to maintain access.

- **Remote Access Trojans (RATs)**: Malware that give remote control of a system.

### Phase 3: Delivery 📦

This is the third phase where the attacker sends the weaponized payload to the target’s system. Some common delivery methods include:

- **Phishing**: Emails or text messages with malicious attachments or links.

- **Drive-by Downloads**: Malware download that automatically starts when visiting a malicious website.

- **Email Spoofing**: Pretending to be a trusted sender to trick victims into opening malicious attachments.


### Phase 4: Exploitation 🔓

This is the fourth phase where the attacker takes advantage of a vulnerability in the target’s system to execute the malicious code. This is when the weaponized payload actually “breaks in” and starts running on the victim’s device. It involves things like:

- Taking advantage of software bugs or security flaws.

- Using malware to trigger code execution.

- Escalating privileges to gain more control over of the system.

### Phase 5: Installation 📂

This is the fifth phase where the attacker has successfully exploited a vulnerability on the target's system and begins installing additional malware on the system to maintain access and control. This can include installation of malware like:

- Backdoors

- Trojans

- RATs

- Rootkits

- Keyloggers

- Spyware


### Phase 6: Command and Control (C2) 📟

This is the sixth phase where the attacker takes remote control of the compromised system by setting up communication between their system and the compromised system. This allows the attacker to issue commands and carry out other malicious acts without having to re-exploit the system. Common methods include:

- **HTTP/HTTPS** (mimicking normal web traffic)

- **DNS tunneling** (hides commands inside DNS queries and responses)

- **C2 frameworks** (Sliver C2, Cobalt Strike, Metasploit)

### Phase 7: Actions on Objectives 👨‍💻

This is the seventh and final phase where the attacker has successfully executed their intended goals, whether it's stealing data, disrupting operations, or installing ransomware. Common actions can include:

- **Data Theft**: Exfiltrating sensitive data or intellectual property.

- **Disruption**: Deploying ransomware or launching DDoS attack.

- **Persistance**: Installing backdoors on compromised system for future access.

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. Simulate a full attack lifecycle using all 7 phases of the Cyber Kill Chain.

2. Simulate attacks aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques used by attackers in the real world.

3. Document every phase of the attack in detail with step-by-step breakdowns.

4. Identify how **defenders (Blue Teamers)** can break the kill chain at each phase through security controls.

5. Display hands-on ethical hacking experience in a controlled lab environment.
