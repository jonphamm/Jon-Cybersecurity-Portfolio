## Case Study
The case study is written on the basis of a fictional company:

Store My Bits International (SMBI) is a well-known cloud data storage company of which you are the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Recently, a phishing scheme was released that introduced multiple viruses into your environment. 

After spending over $2 million eradicating these threats, the CEO demands that a full cybersecurity analysis be performed and a strategic plan be drafted to reduce the company's exposure to breaches. 

As part of the plan, he wants to know how vulnerabilities will be identified, how incidents will be responded to, and what contingencies will need to be in place. Your job is to come up with the plan to address these issues.
