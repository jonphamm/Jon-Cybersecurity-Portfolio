# Network Security and Contingency Planning
## Case Study Scenario
The case study is written on the basis of a fictional company with Security Solutions/Tools that I currently utilize at my own company:

Store My Bits International (SMBI) is a well-known cloud data storage company of which you are the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Recently, a phishing scheme was released that introduced multiple viruses into your environment. 
After spending over $2 million eradicating these threats, the CEO demands that a full cybersecurity analysis be performed and a strategic plan be drafted to reduce the company's exposure to breaches. 
As part of the plan, he wants to know how vulnerabilities will be identified, how incidents will be responded to, and what contingencies will need to be in place. Your job is to come up with the plan to address these issues.

### Project Scope
The scope of the cybersecurity analysis and strategic plan will include the following key components:
* Vulnerability Identification
* Incident Response Planning
* Business Continuity and Contingency Planning
* Employee Training and Awareness
* Ongoing Risk Management and Monitoring

### Current Security Posture
The core reason SMBIâ€™s cybersecurity posture was weak when attacked is a lack of proactive security measures and an over-reliance on reactive responses. The organization had no comprehensive strategy for vulnerability management, incident detection, or employee awareness. Additionally, SMBI lacked a formalized incident response plan and adequate network defenses, all of which led to the attack escalating from an initial compromise to a massive, costly breach.

**Key contributors to this weak posture included:**
* Ineffective employee training on security best practices, leading to successful phishing attempts.
* Outdated security systems (firewalls, IDS/IPS, EDR) that failed to detect and stop the attack.
* Lack of consistent vulnerability management and patching protocols.
* No incident response or recovery plan to quickly mitigate the damage and restore normal business operations.

### Goals
The primary goal of this cybersecurity analysis and strategic plan is to drastically reduce SMBI's vulnerability to cyberattacks and establish a robust framework for ongoing security. This will be achieved through the following specific goals:
* Enhance Vulnerability Management and Risk Mitigation
* Improve Incident Detection and Response
* Strengthen Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery
* Promote a Culture of Cybersecurity Awareness
* Ongoing Risk Monitoring and Threat Intelligence

### Security Solutions/Tools
To successfully implement the cybersecurity analysis and strategic plan for Store My Bits International (SMBI), we will leverage various tools and technologies that align with the project's scope and goals.

#### 1. Vulnerability Identification:
* **Nmap (Network Scanning and Vulnerability Mapping)**
  - Used to perform comprehensive network scans to identify open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities in SMBI's infrastructure. 
  - Nmap will help identify critical assets and security gaps in the infrastructure.
* **Nessus (Vulnerability Scanning)**
  - Nessus is a widely-used vulnerability scanner that can automatically identify known vulnerabilities and security flaws in systems, applications, and configurations.
  - Nessus will provide SMBI with a comprehensive list of vulnerabilities, classified by severity, to prioritize remediation efforts.

#### 2. Incident Response Planning:
* **CrowdStrike Falcon (Endpoint Detection & Response)**
  - The endpoint protection tool will be used to monitor SMBI's workstations and servers for suspicious activities, such as malware, ransomware, and unauthorized access attempts.
  - CrowdStrike will provide enhanced visibility into endpoints, allowing for faster detection and response to potential threats.

#### 3. Business Continuity and Contingency Planning:
* **Cloudflare (DDoS Protection & Traffic Routing)**
  - Cloudflare will be used to mitigate DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks and to ensure high availability of SMBI's cloud infrastructure by rerouting traffic in case of an attack.
  - Cloudflare helps ensure the availability and security of SMBI's online services, reducing downtime from attacks.
 
#### 4. Employee Training and Awareness
* **KnowBe4 (Security Awareness Training)**
  - KnowBe4 offers a comprehensive platform for phishing simulations and security awareness training. It will be used to train SMBI employees to recognize phishing attempts, social engineering, and other common attack vectors.
  - KnowBe4 will educate employees on security best practices, reducing the likelihood of successful phishing attacks.
 
### Conclusion
By implementing these tools, SMBI will be equipped to achieve its cybersecurity goals. Each tool aligns with a specific aspect of the cybersecurity strategy, from vulnerability management and incident response to business continuity, employee training, and risk monitoring. This integrated approach will help reduce SMBI's exposure to breaches, streamline its incident response, and maintain its reputation as a secure and trustworthy cloud storage provider.
