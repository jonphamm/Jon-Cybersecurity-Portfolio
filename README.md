# Jon Pham's Cybersecurity Portfolio
As an aspiring cybersecurity professional, I specialize in penetration testing, network security, and vulnerability management, with a strong focus on practical, hands-on experience. Through a series of self-driven projects, Iâ€™ve developed a deep understanding of identifying, exploiting, and securing vulnerabilities within systems and networks. My journey includes creating and simulating cyberattacks, as well as deploying defensive measures like firewalls, IDS/IPS systems, and network monitoring tools.
