# JonCybersecurityPortfolio
In my projects, I simulate real-world cyberattacks, analyze security flaws, and build robust defenses to secure systems. I've worked with penetration testing tools like Metasploit, Kali Linux, and Wireshark, and have hands-on experience with network monitoring, firewall configuration, and IDS/IPS setups.
