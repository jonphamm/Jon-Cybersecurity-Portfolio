As an aspiring **cybersecurity professional**, I have a strong interest in penetration testing, network security, cloud security, and vulnerability management. I make sure to focus on practical, hands-on experience through numerous projects where Iâ€™ve developed a deep understanding of identifying, exploiting, and securing vulnerabilities within systems and networks. My journey includes creating and simulating cyberattacks, as well as deploying defensive measures like firewalls, IDS/IPS systems, and network monitoring tools. I am currently also working on an on-premises to Microsoft Azure cloud migration project, where I design and implement Microsoft Intune policies to secure all corporate endpoints and establish automated configurations for streamlined management.
