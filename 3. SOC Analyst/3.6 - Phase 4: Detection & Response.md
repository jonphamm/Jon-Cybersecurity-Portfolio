# Phase 4: Detection and Repsonse with LimaCharlie

## A) Observing EDR Telementry Gathered from LimaCharlie

We will now view the EDR telemetry gathered by LimaCharlie.

1. Open up the **LimaCharlie web UI**: https://limacharlie.io/

2. Log into your account and open the **Organization** you created.
  
3. Click **Sensors** on the left-side menu.

4. Click on your active **Windows sensor**.

5. Click on **Processes** on the left-side menu.

6. As you can see below, the **processes** with the **yellow wi-fi symbol** are **active** on the network. You can see the **C2 payload** running as well.

</br>

7. Hover over the **C2 payload** or click the **3 vertical dots** to the left of the payload.

8. Find and click on the **View Network Connections** option.

> [!NOTE]
> Here you will see the **network connections** for your **C2 payload**.

</br>

9. Next, click on **Timeline** on the left-side menu. This provides a real-time view of EDR telemetry and event logs from the Windows 10 VM.

## B) Detecting the Attacker's Actions

Now, we will perform an **adversary action** and detect it on **LimaCharlie**.

1. First, we ensure we have correct privileges to perform privileged actions on the host machine.
   
   ````
   getprivs
   ````

> [!NOTE]
> A powerful privilege to check for is "**SeDebugPrivilege**", which allows code to inspect and modify the memory and state of other processes.

</br>

2. Next, we will "**steal**" credentials from a Windows 10 VM system by dumping the "**lsass.exe**" process from the memory.

   - In the **Sliver shell** on the Ubuntu SSH session, run the following command:

     ````
     procdump -n lsass.exe -s lsass.dmp
     ````

> [!NOTE]
> This will **dump** the remote process from memory and save it **locally** on your Sliver C2 server.

</br>

3. Now, switch over to **LimaCharlie web UI** to locate the relevent telemetry.

> [!NOTE]
> The **lsass.exe** is a known sensitive process often targeted by credential dumping tools, so it's highly likely that a good EDR tool would generate events from this dump.

</br>

4. Dive deeper into the **Timeline** of the **Windows 10 VM sensor** by searching for "**SENSTIVE_PROCESS_ACCESS**" events.
