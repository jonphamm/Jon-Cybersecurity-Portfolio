## ‼️ IMPORTANT‼️ VM Network Adapter Configurations:

Ensure the Network Adapter configurations are set to "NAT" (Network Address Translation) when setting up your Ubuntu and Windows 10 virtual machines.

NAT allows your virtual machines to share the host machine’s IP address, enabling them to access the internet while remaining isolated from the external network. This enhances security and simplifies setup. It’s like having a firewall between your VM and the outside world, reducing the attack surface.

Unlike Bridged mode, which places the VM directly on the physical network. The VM gets its own IP on the local network, making it visible and potentially accessible to other devices on that network. This can increase risks, especially on untrusted or public networks.
