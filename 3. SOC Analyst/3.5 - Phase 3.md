# Phase 3: Simulating Attacker Behavior Using Sliver C2

## A) Setting Up Sliver C2 Framework on Ubuntu VM

**Sliver** is a powerful **command and control (C2)** framework designed to provide advanced capabilities for controlling remote systems. It is open-source and can be used for security testing, and unfortunately, by bad actors as well.

> [!NOTE]
> With Sliver, security professionals, red teams, and penetration testers can easily establish a secure and reliable communication channel over Mutual TLS, HTTP(S), DNS, or Wireguard with target machines.

### On the Ubuntu VM:

1. Log in with the credentials you set up for your Ubuntu VM.

2. Switch to a **root** command prompt:
   
  ````
  sudo su
  ````
3. We need to ensure the IP address of the Ubuntu VM does not change.
   
   - Find the **ens33** - **inet IP** with the following command:
     
     ````
     ip a
     ````

4. Find the gateway IP address of the VM with the following command:

````
ping _gateway -c 1
````

> [!NOTE]
> Take note of the Ubuntu VM's IP and gateway IP as you will need it again throughout this project.

5. Edit the configuration file for the network manager "netplan" with the following command:

````
sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
````

6. The GNU nano page will populate and you will need to enter the following information:

   - Be sure to change the "xxx" to your VM's specific IP addresses.
