# Phase 3: Simulating Attacker Behavior Using Sliver C2

## A) Setting Up Sliver C2 Framework on Ubuntu VM

**Sliver** is a powerful **command and control (C2)** framework designed to provide advanced capabilities for controlling remote systems. It is open-source and can be used for security testing, and unfortunately, by bad actors as well.

> [!NOTE]
> With Sliver, security professionals, red teams, and penetration testers can easily establish a secure and reliable communication channel over Mutual TLS, HTTP(S), DNS, or Wireguard with target machines.

### On the Ubuntu VM:

1. Log in with the credentials you set up for your Ubuntu VM.

2. Switch to a **root** command prompt:
   
  ````
  sudo su
  ````
3. We need to ensure the IP address of the Ubuntu VM does not change.
   
   - Find the **ens33** - **inet IP** with the following command:
     
     ````
     ip a
     ````

4. Find the gateway IP address of the VM with the following command:

````
ping _gateway -c 1
````

> [!NOTE]
> Take note of the Ubuntu VM's IP and gateway IP as you will need it again throughout this project.
