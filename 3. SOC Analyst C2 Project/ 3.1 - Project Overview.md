# SOC Analyst Lab with Sysmon, LimaCharlie, and Sliver C2: Bypassing Defenses and Detecting Attacks
In this project, I simulate a real-world adversarial scenario using a Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) as the target and an Ubuntu VM as the attacker platform. This hands-on exercise demonstrates the responsibilities of a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst and how attackers disable system defenses, establish persistent access, and how defenders can detect and respond using custom detection rules. 

## Phase 1: Weakening the Target – Disabling Windows VM Defenses
The lab begins with simulating an attacker’s first move: removing built-in Windows security controls to reduce resistance.

### ✅ Steps Taken:
1. Turned off Virus & Threat Protection: Using the Windows Security GUI, all real-time protection features were disabled.

2. Modified Group Policy Settings: Used the Group Policy Editor to enforce changes that disable key Defender components.

3. Disabled Power Configurations: Sleep, hibernation, and monitor timeout settings were set to 0 using "powercfg" commands to keep the system continuously available.

4. Enabled Safe Boot: Configured using "msconfig" to force the system into minimal boot mode for tamper-resistant persistence.

5. Edited the Windows Registry: Manually set critical Windows Defender-related services to a disabled startup state (Start = 4) including:
  a) Sense
  b) WdBoot 
  c) WinDefend
  d) WdNisDrv 
  e) WdNisSvc
  f) WdFilter

These changes render the system defenseless, mimicking a compromised endpoint in the real world.

## Phase 2: Installing Sysmon & LimaCharlie for Visibility
With defenses removed, I then shifted to simulating how a security team might regain visibility using telemetry.

### 🧰 Tools Deployed:

**Sysmon:** Captures event logs including process creation, network connections, driver loads, and more. 

**LimaCharlie:** A cloud-native security operations platform used to ingest Sysmon logs and build custom detection rules.

### 🛠 Setup Process:
1. Installed Sysmon with a recommended configuration (SwiftOnSecurity).

2. Installed the LimaCharlie agent on the Windows VM.

3. Created an organization in LimaCharlie and configured the agent to ingest Sysmon logs.

4. Now the Windows VM, though defenseless, is under active observation—ideal for detection engineering.

## Phase 3: Simulating Attacker Behavior Using Sliver C2
To emulate a real-world adversary, I used the Sliver C2 Framework on an Ubuntu VM.

### 📌 Attacker Setup:

1. Gathered network information from the Ubuntu VM.

2. Edited **/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml** to set static network values.

3. SSH’d into the Ubuntu box, downloaded, and installed Sliver.

4. Launched the Sliver C2 server and generated a Windows payload.

The payload was then pulled onto the Windows VM and executed, giving Sliver interactive access, just like a real command-and-control (C2) session.

## Phase 4: Detection and Response with LimaCharlie
With the attack in progress, I moved to the defensive side using LimaCharlie to detect and respond.

### 👁 What I Observed:

Sysmon telemetry from the infected Windows VM flowed into LimaCharlie.

LimaCharlie highlighted suspicious behaviors, such as new network connections and unknown process trees.

### 🧠 Detection Engineering:

1. Checked VirusTotal for malware signatures directly through LimaCharlie.

2. Created a custom detection rule to flag specific command-line behaviors and anomalies.

3. Saw the rule trigger successfully in response to Sliver activity.

## Learning Outcomes
This lab provided a full-circle view of both **offensive** and **defensive** operations in cybersecurity:

* Offensive Skills	
* Defensive Skills
* Windows hardening evasion	
* Sysmon deployment and configuration
* Registry and service tampering	
* Threat hunting through LimaCharlie
* C2 installation (Sliver)	
* Detection engineering
* Payload delivery	

By simulating a breach and then detecting it, I gained a clear view of how attackers operate, and how defenders can detect and respond using telemetry, rules, and automation.
