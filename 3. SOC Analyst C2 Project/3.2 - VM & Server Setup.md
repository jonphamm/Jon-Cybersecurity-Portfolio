## IMPORTANT: VM Network Adapter Configurations‚ÄºÔ∏è

Ensure the Network Adapter configurations are set to **NAT (Network Address Translation)** when setting up your Ubuntu and Windows 10 virtual machines.

**NAT** allows your virtual machines to share the host machine‚Äôs IP address, enabling them to access the internet while remaining isolated from the external network. This enhances security and simplifies setup. It‚Äôs like having a firewall between your VM and the outside world, reducing the attack surface.

Unlike **Bridged mode**, which places the VM directly on the physical network. The VM gets its own IP on the local network, making it visible and potentially accessible to other devices on that network. This can increase risks, especially on untrusted or public networks.
